# Assignement3
Callback and Events
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======


# Pre-requisites
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 16.17.0


# Getting started
- Clone the repository
```
git clone  <git lab template url> <project_name>
```

- to run project in VS code console type
- node index.js

# Task to do 

- Callback functions and creating custom events using the events core module in Node. 
- Steps To Do: 
- The variable input has the input value. 
- Extract n1 and n2 from the input. Write a function to find the sum of all the multiples of n1 and n2, below and including 1000. This function should log the sum after 2 seconds.
- Register an event named MyEvent for any instance of an event emitter, and bind a function named logInfo to it, which logs "Multiplesof {n1} {n2}"to the console and emit the event.
- Constraints 
    - Input: input, a string separated by space 
    - Output: strings separated by newline 

Input Format For Custom Testing:
The first line contains a string, input, which should be used to calculate multiples and log in output. 


# Output 

- Sample Case 0:
- Sample Input For Custom Testing 100 1000 
- Sample Output Multiples of 100 1000 6500 
- Explanation Multiples of 100 are 100,200,300,......1000 and multiples of 1000 is 1000 in below and including 1000. Sum = (100+200+............1000) + 1000 Sum = 6500 

- Sample Case 1 
- Sample Input For Custom Testing 500 1200 
- Sample Output Multiples of 500 1200 1500
